    <h2><strong>Oppenheimer Movie Critic Reviews</strong></h2>

    <div id="container">

        <p>&ldquo; Oppenheimer is the most important story of our time. &rdquo;<br/>&mdash; Lachmi Deb Roy </p>
 
        <p>&ldquo; What he [Nolan] has put before our eyes definitively deserves to be seen, as does Cillian Murphy's performance in the role of Oppenheimer and the irreconcilable but fantastic Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Lewis Strauss. [Full review in Spanish] &rdquo;<br/>&mdash; Sergio Bustein </p>
 
        <p>&ldquo; His latest effort is too much of an endurance test, a magnum opus consumed by its quest for significance... &rdquo;<br/>&mdash; Ruben Rosario </p>
  
        <p>&ldquo; The explosion of the test bomb is a bravura dance of imagery and sound, but also lack of sound. It is an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely what is to come. &rdquo;<br/>&mdash; Michael Calleri </p>
  
        <p>&ldquo; Oppenheimer is mythic, massive, and a masterful work from Christopher Nolan. Murphy & Downey Jr. deliver career best performances in what is the most important movie of the decade. &rdquo;<br/>&mdash; Anthony Gagliardi </p>
  
        <p>&ldquo; Oppenheimer is a flawed genius who can grapple with the intricacies of quantum mechanics but can not resolve the moral dilemmas that plague his public and private lives. &rdquo;<br/>&mdash; John McDonald </p>
  
        <p>&ldquo; Armed with a haunting Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan gives us his most personal and political film yet, that is fascinating as it is flawed. &rdquo;<br/>&mdash; Gautam Sundar </p>
